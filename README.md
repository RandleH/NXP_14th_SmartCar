The Smart Car project aims at providing a reliable automation driving algorithm for the NXP SmartCar Contest.

The NXP SmartCar Contest is a creative science and technology competition that takes smart cars as the research project. It is an exploratory engineering practice activity for college students across the country. It is also one of the college student science and technology competitions advocated by the Ministry of Education.

The target of the C-Smart-Car Project is NXP MK66FX ARM Cortex-M MCU and MT9V032 CMOS Digital Image Sensor.The board has built-in JTAG for programming and emulation, H-Bridge Motor port breaking out PWM, UARTs, SCCB port for camera, SPI port for TFT screen and reserved I/O headers.
